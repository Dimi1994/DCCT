# DDoS' Cyberpunk Combat Tracker
Peace choom, my name's DDoS. Sometimes, when I'm not busy netrunning or writing malware, I'm a game master for Cyberpunk RED. And since I know how chaotic combat can get, I coded this combat tracker to help you keep your sessions running smoothly. Use it well, and don't get flatlined.

How do I install it?

That's the neat part. You don't. Seriously, no installation needed. Just download and open this .html file in your browser, and you're good to go. Code's clean. I promise I didn't inject any Black ICE this time. What I find so convenient about this is, that, if you already use your corebooks and character sheets in your browser, the Combat Tracker is just another tab.

Features at a Glance
- Automated Damage & Armor Handling ‚Äì No need to calculate double damage, half armor rounded up plus damage from critical injury in your head.
- Initiative Sorting ‚Äì No more manual order tracking.
- Toggleable Columns ‚Äì Hide stats you don‚Äôt need to keep the UI clean.
- Save & Load Encounters ‚Äì Prepare fights in advance or continue mid-combat next session.

How to Use This Tracker

- Click the "Add Character" button to add as many characters as you need. Alternatively, load a preciously saved character.
- Roll Initiative, enter the values, and click "Sort" to order the characters.
- Enter damage in the "Damage" field and click "Apply" to track it. HP and armor values auto-update.
- Use checkboxes to manage armor and effects:
  - Half Armor: Reduces SP by 50% (rounded up) for damage calculation.
  - Ignore Armor: Bypass SP completely.
  - Headshots: Double damage. Double the pain. Uses head SP of course, which is reduced afterwards.
  - Critical: Rolled two sixes? +5 damage, no matter if armor is penetrated or not.
  - Armor Piercing: Lowers SP by an extra 1. I know, some weapons ablate armor even more, but for those rare edge-cases you can adjust SP manually (just like any other stat!).
- Keep notes in the "Notes" column. Track cyberware, critical injuries, status effects, grenades, or plot armor.
- Toggle stats with the Show/Hide checkboxes. Some GMs don't roll Death Saves for NPCs. Others don't have their NPCs reload their mags. Just hide what you don't need.
- Click the ‚ùå button to delete a character after you zero them.
- Duplicate a character with üìÑ.
- Export a character with üíæ.

Le Epic Feature

Use "Save Session" and "Load Session" to save and load combat encounters. Why is this so epic?
Pre-plan combat encounters: Prepare your combat encounters before the session and load them the exact moment when combat begins. No more "hold on I need to set up the enemies" moments.
Pause and resume sessions: It's already past midnight and you need to get up early tomorrow. Save your current encounter and continue it next time. No need to rush or forget where you left off.

That's it. Now go out there and burn corpo shit.
